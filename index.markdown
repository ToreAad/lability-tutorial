Hello, GitHub üë®‚Äçüíª

This is a tutorial for working with [Lability](https://github.com/VirtualEngine/Lability/).

I recently found Lability and really came to like it.
However, unfortunately its documentation is a bit sparse.
I am writing this tutorial to help people get started with this dope module for building Hyper-V test labs.
I hope it's useful.

## Tutorial status

This tutorial not yet complete -
below you can find a table of contents / to do list.
Where a chapter has been started (not necessarily completed!),
there will be a link to the chapter;
where a chapter has not yet been started,
there will be a list of things to cover.

## Target audience

Who should read this tutorial?

 -  I assume a mid-level Powershell background.
    You should be comfortable reading and writing Powershell scripts.
 -  I assume at least a passing familiarity with Powershell DSC.
    You may not have written a DSC configuration before,
    but you should understand at a high level what DSC is for
    and be willing to research concepts you don't understand.
 -  You should be able to use the Hyper-V GUI tools on a Windows client OS (such as Windows 10 Pro).
    We don't do anything too complex with Hyper-V in this tutorial,
    but you should understand basic concepts like VMs, VHDs, VSwitches, and so forth.

## Tutorial chapters

1.  [An introduction to Lability](01-Introduction)

2.  [A simple configuration](02-Simple)

3.  [Debugging VMs that won't come up](03-Debugging):
    the previous single VM lab, but with a faulty DSC configuration
    that prevents the machine from ever presenting the logon screen.

     -  Logging in via Powershell remoting if possible
     -  Resetting the VMs so you can log on and see what went wrong
     -  DSC logs in Event Viewer
     -  Lability logs in C:\Bootstrap
     -  Deleting existing VHDs before redeploying a lab when troubleshooting
     -  Filtering the error list

4.  Expanding our simple VM example

     -  Add an additional node
     -  Explain `NodeName = '*'`
     -  Types of switches and what happens if the switch doesn't already exist
     -  Lab prefixes
     -  Custom resources (install Firefox)
     -  DSC modules, version specifiers, and what happens if DSC modules are not defined in the config data

5.  NAT network configuration:
    two VMs, one with two NICs acting as a NAT gateway, and one with just one NIC behind the NAT.

     -  Discuss problems related to two NICs and nondeterministic switch assignment order
     -  Discuss double-NAT
     -  Show how to connect to the VMs behind NAT via PS remoting if the gateway is up

6.  AD domain behind NAT network:
    three VMs, one domain controller, one NAT gateway, and one Windows 10 client

     -  Discuss ordering of resources in the config file to minimize errors
     -  Show example of Windows event forwarding

7.  Back matter (?)

     -  Powershell DSC concepts
     -  Lability concepts

Other items on my mind:

1.  In the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (Windows 10 build 1709), Hyper-V started shipping with a default NAT network.
    That will make configuration easier, but my work machine doesn't have 1709 yet, so I can't test with it.
